    <h1>Human population Growth</h1>
    <p>Human population growth has been a defining characteristic of our species' history, profoundly influencing
        societies, economies, and the environment. From modest beginnings, the global population has surged,
        particularly in recent centuries, leading to both opportunities and challenges.</p>
    <h2>Historical Overview</h2><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR_3QwcwKlL8BbqDY709dTrHIpOEOi-G3XABA&s" alt="">
    <p>For most of human history, population growth was gradual. Early human societies maintained relatively stable
        numbers, with growth rates kept in check by factors such as limited food resources, diseases, and high mortality
        rates. However, significant milestones, such as the Agricultural Revolution around 10,000 BCE, allowed for more
        reliable food production, leading to gradual population increases.</p>
    <p>The Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries marked a turning point. Advancements in medicine,
        sanitation, and agriculture led to a dramatic decline in mortality rates, especially among infants and children.
        This period saw the global population grow from approximately 1 billion in 1800 to 2.5 billion by 1950. The
        post-World War II era experienced an even more rapid increase, often referred to as the "population explosion,"
        with numbers reaching 5 billion by 1987 and 8 billion by mid-November 2022.</p>
    <h2>Current Trends</h2>
    <u>
        <li>Decreasing Fertility Rates: Worldwide, fertility rates have fallen, with the global average dropping from 5
            births per woman in 1950 to around 2.5 in recent years. This trend is influenced by increased access to
            education, family planning services, and shifts in societal norms.</li>
        <li>Urbanization: More people are living in urban areas, where the cost of raising children is higher, and
            access to education and employment opportunities often leads to smaller family sizes.</li>
        <li>Economic Development: As countries develop economically, there is a tendency for birth rates to decline, a
            phenomenon known as the demographic-economic paradox.</li><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSmT1YJDDrDK8wOU5MmB-tF-HeGrll2l5vGmA&s" alt="">
    </u>
    <h2>Future Projections</h2>
    <p>Looking ahead, projections suggest that the global population will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. The
        United Nations estimates a rise to approximately 9.7 billion by 2050, with a peak of around 10.4 billion in the
        mid-2080s, followed by a gradual decline.</p>
    <p>Notably, population growth will not be uniform across the globe. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to experience
        significant increases, potentially doubling its population by 2050. In contrast, some regions, such as Eastern
        Europe and parts of Asia, may witness population declines due to low birth rates and aging populations.</p>
