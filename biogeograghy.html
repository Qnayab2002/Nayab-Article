    <h2> The Study of Life and Its Distribution</h2>
    <p>Biogeography is the scientific study of the distribution of life forms—plants, animals, and microorganisms—across
        geographical areas and through geological periods. It examines patterns of species distribution and seeks to
        understand the processes that result in these patterns, integrating knowledge from ecology, evolutionary
        biology, geology, and climatology.</p><img

    <h2>Historical Foundations</h2>
    <p>The roots of biogeography trace back to the 18th and 19th centuries, marked by significant contributions from
        pioneering naturalists:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Carl Linnaeus: In the mid-18th century, Linnaeus developed a classification system for organisms and
            proposed the "Mountain Explanation" for species distribution, suggesting that species dispersed from Mount
            Ararat after the biblical flood.</li>
        <li>Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon: He observed that different regions have distinct plants and animals,
            leading to "Buffon's Law," which posits that environmentally similar but geographically isolated regions
            have distinct species.</li><img

        <li>Alexander von Humboldt: Dubbed the "founder of plant geography," Humboldt studied the relationship between
            climate and plant distribution, introducing concepts like isotherms to map temperature variations.</li>
        <li>Alfred Russel Wallace: Known as the "father of biogeography," Wallace identified the faunal boundary line
            (Wallace Line) separating species with Asian and Australian affinities in the Malay Archipelago.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Branches of Biogeography</h2>
    <p>Biogeography encompasses several sub-disciplines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Historical Biogeography: Investigates the evolutionary history of species and their distributions,
            considering factors like continental drift and glaciation.</li>
        <li>Ecological Biogeography: Focuses on current factors, such as climate and habitat, influencing species
            distribution.</li>
        <li>Island Biogeography: Studies species diversity and distribution on islands, providing insights into
            colonization and extinction processes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Modern Applications</h2>
    <p>Today, biogeography informs conservation efforts by identifying biodiversity hotspots and understanding the
        impacts of climate change on species distribution. Technological advancements, such as Geographic Information
        Systems (GIS), have enhanced the ability to analyze spatial patterns and predict future changes in species
        distributions.</p>
    <p>In summary, biogeography provides critical insights into the patterns and processes governing the distribution of
        life on Earth, bridging historical events with present-day ecological dynamics.</p>
