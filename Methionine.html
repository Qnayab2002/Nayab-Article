    <h1>Methionine and Cysteine</h1>

    <p>
        Methionine and Cysteine are the two amino acids that contain sulfur. These amino acids play crucial roles in human health
        and biological functions. Sulfur-containing amino acids are important in protein synthesis, enzyme activity, and detoxification processes.
    </p>

    
<h2>List of Sulfur-Containing Amino Acids</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Methionine (Met):</strong> An essential amino acid that serves as a methyl group donor and is involved in the initiation of protein synthesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Cysteine (Cys):</strong> A semi-essential amino acid that plays a key role in maintaining protein structure via disulfide bonds and in antioxidant activity.</li>
    </ul>
